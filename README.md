# Node.js Test Bootstrap
> A sample repository to demonstrate bootstrapping an existing Node.js project to enable testing with Mocha, Chai and Sinon

## Bootstrapping
To bootstrap a Node.js project, simply run the bootstrap-tests.sh script and supply the path to the Node.js project you'd like to initialize for testing.

Example: `./bootstrap-tests.sh ./app`

The bootstrap script will install Mocha, Chai and Sinon as dev dependencies, as well as initialize a `test` directory with a sample test.
